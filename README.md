# Mapping_Earthquakes



In this module, you will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

Basic Project Plan
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
